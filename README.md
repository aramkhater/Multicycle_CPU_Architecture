# Multicycle_CPU_Architecture
Overview
This project is a VHDL implementation of a 16-bit Multi-Cycle CPU design. It implements a modular architecture where instructions are executed across multiple clock cycles, allowing for resource sharing of the ALU and memory interfaces. The system is designed to demonstrate fundamental CPU principles, including finite state machine (FSM) control, sign-extended branching, and status flag management.
